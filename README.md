# Xperia XZ1 Compact Battery Cover

This was a little project for my old Sony Xperia XZ1 compact. After a few years, its battery are no longer doing so well, so i thought it could be a fun project to make a battery case for it. Doing this effectively doubled the original battery capacity (added a 3000mAh battery).

## Electronics 

For the project i used 3 off the shelf components, being a 3000mAh battery, a charger board and a angled USB-C wire.
All items was brought on E-Bay, with the links under the picture.

The charger board also have a normal USB interface on the back of it, so wiring is fairly self explanatory.
